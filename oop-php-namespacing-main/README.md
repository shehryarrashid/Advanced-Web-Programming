# Namespacing

* Open namespacing-notes in a browser. Once you have a grasp of namespacing:
    * Take one of your OOP examples from the previous practical sessions.
    * Place your class definitions in separate files and include them into the index.php file. Check this works. 
    * Place your classes files into namespaces. Make sure you understand how namespacing works. 
    * Instead of manually including your files, use autoloading to automatically load your class files.
